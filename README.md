# MirrorAPI

- Imagine you're a developer at a large firm working with a massive codebase.
- You use 100s of APIs.
- One day one of the APIs you use gets upgraded and now sends different fields in its JSON response.
- Now it's your job to sit there and painfully play spot the difference between the responses of the old and new versions of APIs.
- There should be a way to automate this.....


  
Enter MIRROR API! A developer tool that compares two API responses, detects breaking changes, scores the migration risk, and generates a structured change report.  
Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind + shadcn/ui**, and a deterministic JSON diff engine.

## How to Run

1) Clone the files
2) Set up API keys in a .env file in the root directory
3) Open python vitual env + install libs in requirements.txt
4) Open nemotron folder and run main.py

then go back to root directory and type npm install and npm run dev.

enjoy!!!

## 🔍 What it does

Compare **two JSON API responses** (URLs or local sample files)  
Detect field-level changes:
- Added fields
- Removed fields
- Type changes (`string → array`, `number → object`, etc.)

Generate a **migration risk score (0–100)**  
Visual diff table with grouped changes  
Export **Markdown migration report**  
Works with **real APIs** (e.g., RestCountries, SpaceX, Pokémon)  
Deterministic — no AI hallucinations, fully offline compatible
